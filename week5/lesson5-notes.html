    <h1>Lesson 5 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Lesson 9: Working Margins, Padding, Alignment, and Floating</h2>
    
    <h3>Summary: In lesson 9, we talked about different ways we can space our web pages.
                 I find this useful because spacing can make our break a website when going
                 for a certain look.
    </h3>

    <h3>Float is new to me and seeing how they used it made me realize I could've used it in my bookmarks assignment
        to put the boxes next to each other. It allows you to align an element next to another.
    </h3>

    <p>What You'll Learn: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to add margins around elements</li>
        <li>How to add padding within elements</li>
        <li>How to keep everything aligned</li>
        <li>How to use the float property</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 10: Understanding the CSS Box Model and Positioning</h2>
    
    <h3>Summary: In this lesson we learned how to get a better understanding of the CSS elements
        we have been utilizing. We also got a better understanding on how to visualize them. </h3>

    <h3>Visualizing something before writing it in is the best method to start working because you'll
        have an idea on what you want to write and how you'll want it to look.
    </h3>

    <p>What You'll Learn: </p>

        <li>How to manage the flow of text</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 11: Using CSS to Do More with Lists, Text, and Navigation</h2>
    
    <h3>Summary: In this lesson, we learned how to style different types of lists and we learned how to create an image map. 
        To create an image map, you create a list full of photos. You insert the photos into each individual li.  </h3>

    <h3>Both of these can be helpful depending on the type of websites you are aiming to create. The photo map can be used
        in different ways. I plan to surprise my girlfriend with a website full of photos of us that will be linked to videos 
        of our memories for our anniversary.
