Lesson 5: Validating and Debugging Your Code

Summary: In this lesson, we discussed proper ways to debug and identify problems in our code.
They talked about what are common issues and showed us examples of what some code might look like when
we create our own.

We were also introduced to a Debugging tool called W3C Validator. This will help the person
