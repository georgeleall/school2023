Lesson 1: Understanding How the Web Works
==============================================

Summary: Lesson 1 goes over the absolute basic tools of creating a web page. We can see in the example 1.1 that all of the 
basic tags are utilized. These basic tags include, the doctype, the head, the body, the title, and an h1. In this example,
they create a simple web page that states, "Hello World!"

There are other things that are just as important as these basic tools, an index file is the default page when people are 
navigating the directory of your website. An index is the home page of a website. It is where the user will land when navigating
the website.

Lesson 2: Structuting an HTML Document
==============================================

Summary: In this lesson we learned the general basics of HTML and discuss the preparations needed to be made in order to be a
web page developer. We discuss many different tags and their purposes. They also show what each tag looks like in examples.
