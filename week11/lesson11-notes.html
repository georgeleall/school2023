            <h3>Summary: In this lesson, we discuss conditional statements and loops. We have seen
                if statements, while and do while loops, and for loops in class. The conditional statement
                we havent seen before was switch.
            </h3>
    
            <h3>Switch statements allow for you to test multiple conditions on one element at once. You can do this 
                by utilizing Switch and however many cases(conditions) you would like to check at once. This 
                can be useful when you have many conditions to check and can use this as an altertnate to 
                many if statements.
            </h3>

            <h2 class = "w3-container w3-light-blue">Lesson 24: Responding to Events and Using Windows</h2>
    
            <h3>Summary: In this lesson, we talked about event handlers, what they are, what they do, and how they work.
                We talked about the different types of event handlers and the way they work. 
            </h3>
    
            <h3>In the provided example that I include later on in the notes and the one they included in the book, 
                the event handler is "onmouseover". Whenever I would run my mouse over the link, I would get a notification
                saying that I hovered my mouse over the link.
