        <h2 class = "w3-container w3-border w3-round w3-pale-blue w3-border-black">Lesson 25: JavaScript Best Practices</h2>

        <h3>Summary:</h3>

        <p>
            In this lesson, we discuss the importance of minimizing code in order to keep
            up the performance of the web page and not over complicating it. Also keeping
            your code simple and neat will aid people who view it after you are done and will
            be able to understand it better.
        </p>

        <p>
            Creating complex code will make it more difficult for you to address any issues you might encounter.
            Keeping simple code will help reduce the amount of issues you might face in the future and if any
            issues do occur, they will be addressed with ease and will be able to identify them quickly.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection on the Lesson:</h3>
        <p class = "w3-border-bottom w3-padding">Something that stood out to me in this lesson is
            that they emphasized to avoid using JavaScript excessively. I would've assumed
            to have used JavaScript as much as I can since it is a tool, but it makes sense to not
            use it when I don't have to. Many people don't run JavaScript and creating excessive code 
            could slow down your website.
        </p>


        <h2 class = "w3-container w3-border w3-round w3-pale-blue w3-border-black">Lesson 26: Using Third-Party JavaScript Libraries and Functions</h2>

        <h3>Summary:</h3>

        <p> In this lesson, we learned how to utilize JavaScript frameworks and libraries. 
            We learned their uses and a little of how to use them. We also learned why using them could be important
            and how they save headaches for people who are creating similar to code that has been previously created.
        </p>

        <p>
            Going over examples of the uses of both frameworks and libraries shows their usefulness and how much
            time they could save. An example of how we use this in class is W3schools and how we use their 
            customizations to decorate our webpages and it saves a ton of time instead of figuring out the code 
            ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>What You'll Learn: </p>
        <ul class = "w3-ul" >
            <li class="w3-border w3-padding-small">Why you might use a third-party JavaScript library or framework</li>
            <li class="w3-border w3-padding-small">The differences between libraries and frameworks</li>
            <li class="w3-border w3-padding-small">How and when you might use Angular, jQuery, React, and other third-party libraries</li>
            <li class="w3-border w3-padding-small">How to download and use a popular third-party JavaScript library in your applications</li>
            <li class="w3-border w3-padding-small">The benefits of JavaScript frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection on the Lesson:</h3>

        <p class = "w3-border-bottom">I could see myself using libraries and frameworks in the future. They not only shorten
            your code but simplify it too. If I need to meet a deadline for my occupation, utilizing prewritten code is a must.
            JavaScript frameworks will be created to help aid you specifically on your job as well.
