                    <h2><i>Future</i> Full-Stack Developer</h2>

                    <p>I am about to graduate Mt. Sac with my Associate's Degree in Computer Programming in the Fall of 2023. I 
                        was accepted to CSULA and plan on attending there in the Spring of 2024. Although I was accepted 
                        under the major of Computer Information Science, I plan to switch to Computer Science.
                    </p>
                    <!-- e.g. I love building websites, and learning to code! -->
                    <p>I spend a lot of my time watching guitar tutorials and playing video games. I am awaiting my
                        custom parts. I should be receiving them sometime this month or next month. It is a three tone
                        sunburst body from MJT Aged Guitars, a 920D Texas Vintage Pickguard, and a custom neck from Warmoth.
