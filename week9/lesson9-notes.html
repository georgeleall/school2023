        <h2 class = "w3-container w3-black">Lesson 19: Create a section clearly defining ways to write comments in JavaScript</h2>

        <h3 class = "w3-container">Summary: In this lesson, we talk about how we can incorporate JavaScript into our
            websites. The first option they show us is through random content. It could select random
            elements from an array, whether it'd be to display a string or change the color of the webpage.
        </h3>

        <h3 class = "w3-container">We utilized this example in our homework and in class. In our homework, we created 2 different arrays with
            quotes and sources. JavaScript would grab corresponding quotes at random and display them on the webpage. 
            In our in class example, JavaScript would grab a random color and change the color of the webpage every time
            we refreshed the page.
        </h3>

        <p class = "w3-container w3-blue">What You'll Learn: </p>

        </ul>

        <h2 class = "w3-container w3-black">Lesson 20: List the Best Practices for JavaScript as a heading 3, and the listed bullets in an unordered list</h2>

        <h3 class = "w3-container">Summary: In this lesson, we learned about statements and their importance. In the examples, they call a statement
        with certain tasks. In the example, they used a statement called getDate(); which more than likely runs back in 
        the code to execute that statement. </h3>

        <h3 class = "w3-container">In our homework, we would have a similar example. We had a statement that would be called
            getQuote(); in which it would run back in the code to execute whatever was in the function.
        </h3>

        <p class = "w3-container w3-blue">What You'll Learn: </p>

        <h2 class = "w3-container w3-black">Lesson 21: List properties for the document object, list Document Methods, list Basic Node Properties</h2>

        <h3 class = "w3-container">Summary: In this lesson, we talk about the importance of the keyword document and its 
            objects. The keyword document represents the document a web document and whenever you call it, it would be
            document.() whatever you put in there would be what its action.
        </h3>

        <h3 class = "w3-container">There are many different examples on what to put in this document.(), we can put 
            document.write in which it inserts text into the html document. You can also write document.title, 
            where it would grab the title of the html document.
