    <h1>Lesson 4 Notes</h1>

    <h2>Lesson 6: Working with Fonts, Text Blocks, Lists, and Tables</h2>

    <h3>Summary: In this lesson we talked about different ways to style a web page. There is many different stylistic
        options when it comes to designing the website and different codes for different symbols. We also discussed
    how to arrange your web page in different ways. </h3>

    <h3>One of the main things that I really enjoyed learning was the arrangement of multiple columns. I wonder if it will allow
    me to insert photos into each column and I can set up left and right banners for a web page and have content in between
    them. I learned a lot of stylistic tips in this lesson.</h3>

     </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 7: Using External and Internal Links</h2>

    <h3>Summary: In this lesson, we learned how to link internal pages, external pages, and emails in a web page. 
        They showed an example of linking different locations on a web page using an anchor. This allowed for the user
        to click on the link and it will redirect them to a different position of the webpage.
    </h3>
    <h3>We put this lesson to use in many different ways such as linking a web page to go from the top to the bottom and the bottom 
        to the top of a web page. I find this to be useful because if you have a lot of content on your web page, it will
        seem like a drag for the user to scroll through it.

    <h2>Lesson 8: Working Colors, Images, and Multimedia</h2>

    <h3>Summary: In this lesson, they discuss how to select colors, how to style your web page, and how to place and prepare
        images. They also show us how to also add different types of media and how to apply it into the web page. </h3>
    <h3>
        I find these to be useful because despite liking minimalistic and professional looking websites, media is what 
        brings websites to life. The way you style a web page, can make your content pop so, caring about how your web pages
        looks is a must.
